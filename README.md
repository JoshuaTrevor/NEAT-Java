# NEAT-Java
This project aims to create a simple implementation of a NEAT-esque algorithm with a focus on concurrency, memory efficiency and iterative publishing for ease of observation.

It houses a library built from scratch to train generic Neural Networks using an evolutionary model, along with an example implementation using the game 'Snake'

### DEMO
I've created a demonstration of the project by hosting a simple static React application using an agent trained by this library in under two hours at https://snakeai-joshuatrevor.netlify.app/ . If you visit this URL you will be able to watch the agent play Snake.

### NEAT-Go
I've also created a simplified headless implementation in Go at https://github.com/JoshuaTrevor/NEAT-Go
