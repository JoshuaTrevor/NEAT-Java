### NEAT-Java
This project aims to create a simple implementation of a NEAT-esque algorithm with a focus on concurrency, memory efficiency and iterative publishing for ease of observation.

### DEMO
I've created a demonstration of the project by hosting a simple static React application using an agent trained by this library in under two hours at https://snakeai-joshuatrevor.netlify.app/ . If you visit this URL you will be able to watch the agent play "Snake" at high speeds.
